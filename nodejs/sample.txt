The difference is what psychologists call “embodied cognition.” That is, we learn by doing. For a lot of the most important learning events in your life, you actually did something—you walked somewhere or felt something. 
Similarly, Virtual Reality is active, not passive. You learn in ways that people have been learning for hundreds of thousands of years: by having an experience.
